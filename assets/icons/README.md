Create the following directory structure:

assets/
  icons/
    app_icon.png

Place your app icon image file as 'app_icon.png' in the assets/icons/ folder.

For best results, your icon should be:
- At least 1024x1024 pixels (square)
- PNG format with transparent background
- High quality and recognizable at small sizes

The flutter_launcher_icons package will automatically generate all the different sizes needed for Android, iOS, Web, Windows, and macOS.
